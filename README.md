# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This is a simple project based on Neural Network.
In this , the model is trained in such a way that it will tell whether the tumor is Malignant(cancerous) or Benign(non-cancerous).

I have used some libraries such as sklearn.datasets , keras.models , numpy , keras.layers etc.
I have also used StandardScaler to range the values from -1 to 1.

There are total 569 sample of tumors and 30 attributes in it.

The dataset is divided into 3 parts -
1. 500 samples for training
2. 35 samples for validation
3. 34 samples for testing 

It will give the output(label) as 0 or 1. 
0 means Malignant and 1 means Benign.
